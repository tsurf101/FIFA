Think Balance Sheet - Assets = Liabilities 

The process of building a cash flow model
  1. Plan & Design
  2. Obtain all Necessary Information
  3. Construct Basic Framework
  4. Develop Advanced Structure
  5. Validate Assumptions
  6. Test Model 
    - (Always run at 0 CPR, O defaults as the bare minimum). Run at least 5/10 scenarios. If you can tie out to WALS you are gold. 


- A mortgage's expected monlthly payment can be thought of as a discounted geomertric series mutipled by the loan amount. 
  - The summation of the geomertric series is then taken and a simplified solution is expressed.

When it comes to the Asset Cash Flow Generation there are two options to chose from. 
1). Loan level generation 
      - Detailed data is avaliable for each asset 
2). Representative line generation 
      - A representative line can be thought of as an aggregation of similar loan’s attributes as
a single loan or line of information.

At the most basic level, the assets in a structured finance transaction can either remain the same in a definitive
pool or they can revolve. 
1) With a definitive pool, the most preferred method of asset amortization is a loan level analysis where each individual asset is amortized based on the asset’s individual characteristics.
      -A definitive pool means that the assets that the transaction start with are only the assets availabele to the transaction. 
2) A representative line methodology is more appropriate when assets are revolving. 
      -A revolving structure is the other form in which assets can be financed.
      -This means that assets can be added to a pool as the transaction continues throughout time.

(Insert process map Figure 2.5)


-When using a representative line methodology, a notional schedule of amortization needs to be created. 
The schedule is called notional because it is a hypothetical amortization that does not take into account
prepayments, defaults, and recoveries. Later, prepayments, defaults, and recoveries
will use the notional schedule to calculate the actual amortization schedule.

-The typical interest rate vector will be a projected curve
of some type and can be obtained a number of ways. Usually a forward
curve analysis from Bloomberg is sufficient. 
To meet ratings criteria, a stressed curve constructed by the ratings
agencies should be used.

-Prepayments 

----SMM (Single Monthly Mortality) = Dollar amount of period n prepayment/(Beginning of period n current
balance–Period n scheduled principal payment)

----CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate) - The most basic definition of CPR is that it
is an annualized calculation of SMM.   CPR = 1 − (1 − SMM)^12

----PSA (Public Securities Association) - hisotrial data on preyment data on mortgages
This is pretty much a predetermined prepament model by the PSA

----ABS (Absolute Prepayment Speed) - ABS = 100∗SMM/(100 + SMM∗(n − 1))
      n = # of periods that have transpired since origination 
      More appropriate measure of prepayment for shorter term asssets such as auto loans
 
-Institutional investors often purchase asset-backed securities with certain tenors and returns in mind. 
Prepayments can drastically affect the weighted average life of a transaction and can reduce the overall interest paid,
thereby reducing the total return of investment (page 69/221) 

-Stressor for prepayments is a numeric multiple that is multiplied against the prepayment curve at each period. 

-The prepayment calculation is the Beginning Balance multiplied by the percentage asset reduction
in the notional schedule multiplied by the monthly prepayment rate (SMM in our case, workbook)

-As loans approach their final periods they will have to be cleaned up. Defaults take precedence
in calculations since it is assumed that a defaulted loan will not voluntarily prepay.

-When "average" comes up, using the "weighted average.." is more accruate than a mean due to various loan balances, seasoning,
yields, etc. in pools


Chapter 4 Deliquency, Default, and Loss Analysis 

----Delinquency - When a payment is due on a specific date and the obligor fails
to pay the payment by that date the obligor is delinquent
----Default - Often a deliquency eventually becomes a default. When obligors are considered defaulted, they are no longer
expected to make regular payments and legal action typically begins.
----Loss - Gross loss is when a companiy writes off the prinicipal balance of the loan, during the time of a default
----Gross loss is the dollar amount of loan balances that are assumed to remain unpaid

Frank J. Fabozzi, defining a loss as follows " A default is essentially a loan that does not get paid back. A loan may
go into the 90-day delinquent category or even into foreclosure, and still be made current again. So only those loans that
are ultimately liquidated for non-payment are classified as defaulted loans. Losses refer to the dollar amounts lost on defaulted loans. (page 81/221)

As defined by S&P, why static loss data is preferred:
"An analysis of static pool data is preferred, since it demonstrates loss
performance over the full liquidation period of a pool. Static pool data also can provide insight into changing portfolio
characteristics, underwriting, or collection policies. Movement in such variables may not be readily apparent
in dynamic portfolio data because of the constantly changing mix in new and aged receivables. Additionally, data based on
annual losses can understate loss performance during periods of rapid portfolio growth. When analyzing
high-growth portfolios, the current period’s losses may be compared against the prior year’s portfolio. This ‘‘growth adjustment’’
takes into account that losses on new originations may not happen immediately and, therefore, occur in the next annual period.

-Severity is the final cumulative loss percent per vintage. 
  -How much of the original balance of a particular vintage is assumed to be defaulted and uncollectible
-Timing - How much loss has been taken by a certain point in time, end at the final maturity of the assets 
-Loss timing can huge impacts on a model(please see page 90/221)
  - Front Loading impacts excess spread. 
  - Example, if a transaction was modeled with a regular loss curve and losses were actaully back-loaded, triggers and 
  reserve accounts might be inadequate to protect the back-loaded loss
***WAC Loss Curve can be used as a projected loss curve if no trend is evident and there are years of data 


-Deliquency is not considered a default 

-A complete timing curve should always equal 100%

-you can create your own loss or use a preexisting loss curve would be better. For example, Standard Default Assumption (SDA), 
curves are great proxies to determine loss for mortgage prodcuts and ossaionally other long term assets.
 --- Further more, the most basica SDA curve is 100% SDA (look up graph online, this is a simple graph, nothing complex)
 --- Multiplying or dividing the values of the 100% curve creates variations of the curve. So a 50 percent SDA curve contains 1/2 of
     the values for each 
period of the 100 percent curve, while a 200% SDA curve contains 2x the values for each period of the 100% curve.

-SDA curves are constructured with annual defualt rates so for a general majority of models we would need to convert that rate
 to a monthly default rate
 --formula is simple but also can be found on page 101/221

-The asset pool balance is reduced each period by defaults
-Examining losses is a great way to correctly size risk-rated tranches and understanding the actual asset. 


Chapter 5 - Recoveries
- Net less = Gross Loss amount - Recovery amount
- Recovery rate = Recovery amount/Grodd Loss amount
- Loss Severirty = Net less/ Gross loss amount
** Recovery Rate and Loss Severity are inverse concepts 
- Recovery lag is the length of tie it takes from the default date to the recovery of actual cash
- Lidquidation expenses are always very significant expenses 
- Cost of carry is defined as when a loan is considered defaulted there is an interest cost to the ousanding loan until
the asset is liduidated and cash is received. (this is not reported at times)
-An important point about recoveries is that they are included as cash flow for the
waterfall, but do not amortize the asset principal.


Chapter 6 - Liabilities and the Cash Flow Waterfall
-For Structured transactions, any cost that is to be paid from the cash generated by the assets is a liability. 
-"Watefall" can be found in the "priority of payments" section in a term sheet
-Credit enhancement is used to mitigate risk 
- Principal - "Pro Rata" means principal is paid proportionately 
            - "Sequential", principal is first to the senior notes 

Why are new defaults included in the "debt principal due" calculation
      - One of the forms of risk mitigation: using excess cash or spread to cover loss. 
      - Debt has access to prepayments and scheduled amortiization, which provide cash to the waterfall, but 
      defaults are noncash generatings amounts. 

Most transactions are structured so the assets generate more interest than is due to fees and debt interest. 
    -Officiall known as Excess Spread
If there is no excess spread then other sources of credit enchancements are necessary to cover the defaulted amount


Chapter 7 - Advanced Liability Structures 
-Loss Prtection is the single most important reason for advanced liability structures 
-Always look out for triggers in transcations, they could have a powerful impact on the cashflow. 
-Page 129/221 gives several examples of triggers such as "Negative excess spread", "Deliquency", "Rolling average triggers", etc.
-Only triggers that need to be modeled are the ones that can be breached when the cash flow is stressed.
-For most general transactions, Cumulative Default Percentage is going to be the current period's dollar 
default amount divided by the original balance. AND in order to make it cumulative, you add the prior period'defaulted percentage.
-Interest rate swaps are the most commonly used type of swap in a structured transaction
      - All of the amounts are calculated off a notional amortization schedule 
      - Ex/ Sumple fixed-for-floating interest rate swap 
-Reverve Accounts 
  -Easiest form of credit enchancement 
  -Accounts set aside for payments when we have shortfalls. 
  -If the deal has an amortizing reserve, the amount will decrease as the asset pool balance decreases 
  -Calculating reimbursements is one the more complicated parts of modeling reserve accounts.
-Pro Rata means principal is paid proportionally 

Chapter 8 
-Performance Analytics
  -A majirty of parties in a transaction are primarly concerned with yield, loss, and timing of cash flows
    -This can be determined by calculating monthly yield, bond equivalent yield, duration, and WAL calculations
  -Monthly Yield 
    -Used to calculate bond equivalent yield
    -The disocunt rate that makes the present value of all the cash flow from the asset or to the debt equivalent to the
     initial principal balance.
    -For assets, the cashflow that is counted is the 1)yield 2)scheduled amrtization 3)voluntary prepayments 4)recovered principal
    -For debt, the casfhlow that is counted is the 1)interest 2)principal
    -The monthly yield should change until the Present Value difference = 0 
  -Assets - DCF is calculated by summing the voluntary prepayments, amortiization, interest, and receoveries
      & then divded by the assumed monthly yield raised to the period
  -Debt - DCF is the same as above by we are summing only interest & principal now
  -Bond-equivalent yield (BEY), which can be thoguht of as annual yield. There is disagreement between which
   is the best annual yield measure
  -Modified Duration - Duration is a measure of a bond value's sensitivity to rate changes
        -Officially defined by fabozzi as "the approximate percentage change in value for 100 basis point change in rates"
         1/[(1 + yield/k)]*[[1∗PVCF1 + 2∗PVCF2 +· · ·+n∗PCVCFn]/(k*Price)]
         k = periods of the payments 
         n = total period
         PVCF_t = present value of the cash flow in period t discounted by the yield
  -According to the Fabozzi book, Modified duration (and Macaulay) duration are typically poor measures because
   they assume that when interest rates change, 
the cash flow(in particular, prepayments) do not change.
  -FYI: Effective durations( AKA Option-Adjusted duration) is derived using Monte Carlo simulation for obtaining
   the new prices when interest rates change.


Analytics
-Cash In - all cash that is available to pay liabilities
  - Pretty much consists of voluntary perpayments, scheduled asset amortization, asset yield, recoveries from defaulted assets,
  swap flows in, and cash from the reserve account 
-Cash Out - Liabilities

-A Summary Sheet is great addition to a model as it can quickly report the scenario assumptions were, give a cash flow snpashot,
and provide any relevant graphs. 
-WAL calculations does not rely on discounted cash flows, instead a WAL is a calculation based on the amortizaiton
of the assets and liabilities over time.
