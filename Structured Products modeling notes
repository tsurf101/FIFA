The process of building a cash flow model
  1. Plan & Design
  2. Obtain all Necessary Information
  3. Construct Basic Framework
  4. Develop Advanced Structure
  5. Validate Assumptions
  6. Test Model

When it comes to the Asset Cash Flow Generation there are two options to chose from. 
1). Loan level generation 
      - Detailed data is avaliable for each asset 
2). Representative line generation 
      - A representative line can be thought of as an aggregation of similar loan’s attributes as
a single loan or line of information.

At the most basic level, the assets in a structured finance transaction can either remain the same in a definitive
pool or they can revolve. 
1) With a definitive pool, the most preferred method of asset amortization is a loan level analysis where each individual asset is amortized based on the asset’s individual characteristics.
      -A definitive pool means that the assets that the transaction start with are only the assets availabele to the transaction. 
2) A representative line methodology is more appropriate when assets are revolving. 
      -A revolving structure is the other form in which assets can be financed.
      -This means that assets can be added to a pool as the transaction continues throughout time.

-When using a representative line methodology, a notional schedule of amortization needs to be created. 
The schedule is called notional because it is a hypothetical amortization that does not take into account
prepayments, defaults, and recoveries. Later, prepayments, defaults, and recoveries
will use the notional schedule to calculate the actual amortization schedule.
