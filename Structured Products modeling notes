The process of building a cash flow model
  1. Plan & Design
  2. Obtain all Necessary Information
  3. Construct Basic Framework
  4. Develop Advanced Structure
  5. Validate Assumptions
  6. Test Model

When it comes to the Asset Cash Flow Generation there are two options to chose from. 
1). Loan level generation 
      - Detailed data is avaliable for each asset 
2). Representative line generation 
      - A representative line can be thought of as an aggregation of similar loan’s attributes as
a single loan or line of information.

At the most basic level, the assets in a structured finance transaction can either remain the same in a definitive
pool or they can revolve. 
1) With a definitive pool, the most preferred method of asset amortization is a loan level analysis where each individual asset is amortized based on the asset’s individual characteristics.
      -A definitive pool means that the assets that the transaction start with are only the assets availabele to the transaction. 
2) A representative line methodology is more appropriate when assets are revolving. 
      -A revolving structure is the other form in which assets can be financed.
      -This means that assets can be added to a pool as the transaction continues throughout time.

-When using a representative line methodology, a notional schedule of amortization needs to be created. 
The schedule is called notional because it is a hypothetical amortization that does not take into account
prepayments, defaults, and recoveries. Later, prepayments, defaults, and recoveries
will use the notional schedule to calculate the actual amortization schedule.

-The typical interest rate vector will be a projected curve
of some type and can be obtained a number of ways. Usually a forward
curve analysis from Bloomberg is sufficient. 
To meet ratings criteria, a stressed curve constructed by the ratings
agencies should be used.

-Prepayments 

----SMM (Single Monthly Mortality) = Dollar amount of period n prepayment/(Beginning of period n current
balance–Period n scheduled principal payment)

----CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate) - The most basic definition of CPR is that it
is an annualized calculation of SMM.   CPR = 1 − (1 − SMM)^12

----PSA (Public Securities Association) - hisotrial data on preyment data on mortgages
This is pretty much a predetermined prepament model by the PSA

----ABS (Absolute Prepayment Speed) - ABS = 100∗SMM/(100 + SMM∗(n − 1))
      n = # of periods that have transpired since origination 
      More appropriate measure of prepayment for shorter term asssets such as auto loans
 
-Institutional investors often purchase asset-backed securities with certain tenors and returns in mind. 
Prepayments can drastically affect the weighted average life of a transaction and can reduce the overall interest paid,
thereby reducing the total return of investment (page 69/221) 

-Stressor for prepayments is a numeric multiple that is multiplied against the prepayment curve at each period. 

-The prepayment calculation is the Beginning Balance multiplied by the percentage asset reduction
in the notional schedule multiplied by the monthly prepayment rate (SMM in our case, workbook)

-As loans approach their final periods they will have to be cleaned up. Defaults take precedence
in calculations since it is assumed that a defaulted loan will not voluntarily prepay.

-When "average" comes up, using the "weighted average.." is more accruate than a mean due to various loan balances, seasoning, yields, etc. in pools


-Deliquency, Default, and Loss Analysis 

----Delinquency - When a payment is due on a specific date and the obligor fails
to pay the payment by that date the obligor is delinquent
----Default - Often a deliquency eventually becomes a default. When obligors are considered defaulted, they are no longer
expected to make regular payments and legal action typically begins.
----Loss - Gross loss is when a companiy writes off the prinicipal balance of the loan, during the time of a default

Frank J. Fabozzi, defining a loss as follows " A default is essentially a loan that does not get paid back. A loan may
go into the 90-day delinquent category or even into foreclosure, and still be made current again. So only those loans that are ultimately liquidated
for non-payment are classified as defaulted loans. Losses refer to the dollar amounts lost on defaulted loans. (page 81/221)

-Deliquency is not considered a default 

-A complete timing curve should always equal 100%

-you can create your own loss or use a preexisting loss curve would be better. For example, Standard Default Assumption (SDA), 
curves are great proxies to determine loss for mortgage prodcuts and ossaionally other long term assets.
 --- Further more, the most basica SDA curve is 100% SDA (look up graph online, this is a simple graph, nothing complex)
 --- Multiplying or dividing the values of the 100% curve creates variations of the curve. So a 50 percent SDA curve contains 1/2 of the values for each 
period of the 100 percent curve, while a 200% SDA curve contains 2x the values for each period of the 100% curve.

-SDA curves are constructured with annual defualt rates so for a general majority of models we would need to convert that rate to a monthly default rate
