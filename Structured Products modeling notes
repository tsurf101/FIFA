Think Balance Sheet - Assets = Liabilities 

The process of building a cash flow model
  1. Plan & Design
  2. Obtain all Necessary Information
  3. Construct Basic Framework
  4. Develop Advanced Structure
  5. Validate Assumptions
  6. Test Model

When it comes to the Asset Cash Flow Generation there are two options to chose from. 
1). Loan level generation 
      - Detailed data is avaliable for each asset 
2). Representative line generation 
      - A representative line can be thought of as an aggregation of similar loan’s attributes as
a single loan or line of information.

At the most basic level, the assets in a structured finance transaction can either remain the same in a definitive
pool or they can revolve. 
1) With a definitive pool, the most preferred method of asset amortization is a loan level analysis where each individual asset is amortized based on the asset’s individual characteristics.
      -A definitive pool means that the assets that the transaction start with are only the assets availabele to the transaction. 
2) A representative line methodology is more appropriate when assets are revolving. 
      -A revolving structure is the other form in which assets can be financed.
      -This means that assets can be added to a pool as the transaction continues throughout time.

-When using a representative line methodology, a notional schedule of amortization needs to be created. 
The schedule is called notional because it is a hypothetical amortization that does not take into account
prepayments, defaults, and recoveries. Later, prepayments, defaults, and recoveries
will use the notional schedule to calculate the actual amortization schedule.

-The typical interest rate vector will be a projected curve
of some type and can be obtained a number of ways. Usually a forward
curve analysis from Bloomberg is sufficient. 
To meet ratings criteria, a stressed curve constructed by the ratings
agencies should be used.

-Prepayments 

----SMM (Single Monthly Mortality) = Dollar amount of period n prepayment/(Beginning of period n current
balance–Period n scheduled principal payment)

----CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate) - The most basic definition of CPR is that it
is an annualized calculation of SMM.   CPR = 1 − (1 − SMM)^12

----PSA (Public Securities Association) - hisotrial data on preyment data on mortgages
This is pretty much a predetermined prepament model by the PSA

----ABS (Absolute Prepayment Speed) - ABS = 100∗SMM/(100 + SMM∗(n − 1))
      n = # of periods that have transpired since origination 
      More appropriate measure of prepayment for shorter term asssets such as auto loans
 
-Institutional investors often purchase asset-backed securities with certain tenors and returns in mind. 
Prepayments can drastically affect the weighted average life of a transaction and can reduce the overall interest paid,
thereby reducing the total return of investment (page 69/221) 

-Stressor for prepayments is a numeric multiple that is multiplied against the prepayment curve at each period. 

-The prepayment calculation is the Beginning Balance multiplied by the percentage asset reduction
in the notional schedule multiplied by the monthly prepayment rate (SMM in our case, workbook)

-As loans approach their final periods they will have to be cleaned up. Defaults take precedence
in calculations since it is assumed that a defaulted loan will not voluntarily prepay.

-When "average" comes up, using the "weighted average.." is more accruate than a mean due to various loan balances, seasoning, yields, etc. in pools


-Deliquency, Default, and Loss Analysis 

----Delinquency - When a payment is due on a specific date and the obligor fails
to pay the payment by that date the obligor is delinquent
----Default - Often a deliquency eventually becomes a default. When obligors are considered defaulted, they are no longer
expected to make regular payments and legal action typically begins.
----Loss - Gross loss is when a companiy writes off the prinicipal balance of the loan, during the time of a default

Frank J. Fabozzi, defining a loss as follows " A default is essentially a loan that does not get paid back. A loan may
go into the 90-day delinquent category or even into foreclosure, and still be made current again. So only those loans that are ultimately liquidated
for non-payment are classified as defaulted loans. Losses refer to the dollar amounts lost on defaulted loans. (page 81/221)

-Deliquency is not considered a default 

-A complete timing curve should always equal 100%

-you can create your own loss or use a preexisting loss curve would be better. For example, Standard Default Assumption (SDA), 
curves are great proxies to determine loss for mortgage prodcuts and ossaionally other long term assets.
 --- Further more, the most basica SDA curve is 100% SDA (look up graph online, this is a simple graph, nothing complex)
 --- Multiplying or dividing the values of the 100% curve creates variations of the curve. So a 50 percent SDA curve contains 1/2 of the values for each 
period of the 100 percent curve, while a 200% SDA curve contains 2x the values for each period of the 100% curve.

-SDA curves are constructured with annual defualt rates so for a general majority of models we would need to convert that rate to a monthly default rate
 --formula is simple but also can be found on page 101/221

-The asset pool balance is reduced each period by defaults
-Examining losses is a great way to correctly size risk-rated tranches and understanding the actual asset. 


Chapter 5 - Recoveries
- Net less = Gross Loss amount - Recovery amount
- Recovery rate = Recovery amount/Grodd Loss amount
- Loss Severity = Net less/ Gross loss amount
** Recovery Rate and Loss Severity are inverse concepts 
- Recovery lag is the length of tie it takes from the default date to the recovery of actual cash
- Lidquidation expenses are always very significant expenses 
- Cost of carry is defined as when a loan is considered defaulted there is an itnerst cost to the ousanding loan until
the asset is liduidated and cash is received. (this is not reported at times)
-An important point about recoveries is that they are included as cash flow for the
waterfall, but do not amortize the asset principal.


Chapter 6 - Liabilities and the Cash Flow Waterfall
-For Structured transactions, any cost that is to be paid from the cash generated by the assets is a liability. 
-"Watefall" can be found in the "priority of payments" section in a term sheet
-Credit enhancement is used to mitigate risk 
- Principal - "Pro Rata" means principal is paid proportionately 
            - "Sequential", principal is first to the senior notes 

Why are new defaults included in the "debt principal due" calculation
      - One of the forms of risk mitigation: using excess cash or spread to cover loss. 
      - Debt has access to prepayments and scheduled amortiization, which provide cash to the waterfall, but 
      defaults are noncash generatings amounts. 

Most transactions are structured so the assets generate more interest than is due to fees and debt interest. 
    -Officiall known as Excess Spread
If there is no excess spread then other sources of credit enchancements are necessary to cover the defaulted amount


Chapter 7 - Advanced Liability Structures 
-Loss Prtection is the single most important reason for advanced liability structures 
-Always look out for triggers in transcations, they could have a powerful impact on the cashflow. 
-Page 129/221 gives several examples of triggers such as "Negative excess spread", "Deliquency", "Rolling average triggers", etc.
-Only triggers that need to be modeled are the ones that can be breached when the cash flow is stressed.
-For most general transactions, Cumulative Default Percentage is going to be the current period's dollar 
default amount divided by the original balance. AND in order to make it cumulative, you add the prior period'defaulted percentage.
-Interest rate swaps are the most commonly used type of swap in a structured transaction
      - All of the amounts are calculated off a notional amortization schedule 
      - Ex/ Sumple fixed-for-floating interest rate swap 
-Reverve Accounts 
  -Easiest form of credit enchancement 
  -Accounts set aside for payments when we have shortfalls. 
  -If the deal has an amortizing reserve, the amount will decrease as the asset pool balance decreases
