    -loc is label-based
    -iloc is interger position based
    -you can combine loc & iloc using ix
  -The single bracket version gives a Pandas Series, the double bracket version gives a Pandas DataFrame.

For NumpPy arrays you need to use logical_and(), logical_or(), and logical_not() for array comparisions
